   <h1>About Me!</h1> 
   <p>Hello there,my name is Sujit.I am studying in class 6'c' in St. Karens Collegiate School.I am a web developer (not fully, learning ofcourse).I am having dozens of friends but they are useless.But still they are my friends.Recently the covid pandemic has ocurred and that is why I amin't able go to school.I am longing to meet my friends as I would be able to show off the words that I have learnt like Hippopotomonstrossesquipedalian I know they are bit long and twisty but I can pronounce them easily.</p>

   <h2>My dream section</h2> 
   <p>Yes,you saw that right a dream section, Everybody has some goals in their life and so do I so the question is what do you want to become? well,I want to become an IAS officer but before that I would prefer to become a web developer (a bit shocking is'nt) but it is easy to become a web developer, only two things are needed for becoming an easy web developer and that is a cool mind and a motivation to learn.(even I haven't done these things but still I am writing).so I will now like to end up the dream section as I have told you what my dream is.</p>

   <h2>My Hobbies</h2> 
   <p>Well,this is a typical thing.My hobbies are so much that I don't know which to write because there are so much that I love to do, not to mention mischeif that I have done a lot.But most of all I love to read storybooks or comics like recently I am reading a book named <em>Famous Five</em> written by Enid Blyton.It is a interesting book I must say,because I have read many times (at least 4 to 5 times) so,my hobby is not declared till now but you can say that I love storybooks.</p> 
   <hr> 
   <h2>Books I have read</h2> 
   <p>Well,this is the most interesting part because I have read so much that I will be able to do some show off.So,my first book which I have read is Tenali Raman but I don't know the name of the writer (extremely sorry).It was so twisty that I didn't bother to learn.So,this book has many short collections of story.Then,to my second book it's name was Grandma Tale's written by Sudha Murty, my all time favourite writer.Her books are so easy that even a 6 year child could read it.And to my third book which was of Ruskin Bond named The blue Umbrella.I have so many books of Ruskin Bond that I don't want to write.It was a good book I had rather give 8 out of 10 because it was'nt too much interesting.And then to my fourth book which was Secret Seven written by Enid Blyton.It is a set book of 10 books.It is a book of a seven children who goes on a dredful mystery.And then to the fifth book which is Famous Five written by Enid Blyton.It is also a set book of 21 books.This is a book about 4 children and 1 dog who goes on a adventure.</p> 
   <hr> 
   <h2>Games I play</h2> 
   <p>Well,I haven't even thought why I am writing but the thing is I don't play games (I know its unbelievable)I have only played two games and that is Shadow fight 2 and Sniper gun 3d (now,don't tell me to play pubg or freefire,because I am in love with this games,not even the new version of shadow fight 2) now you will be wondering why I aim'nt playing these games because of the restrictions my brother always says to make a game not to play a game,so I started learning python (programming language) but it seemed too hard to me so I left it and started learning web development but the most important thing is I still play this games (secretly,you know).</p> 
   <hr> 
   <h2>My Favorite Food</h2> 
   <p>This is the most favourite section.I know everybody loves to eat food (expect some gamers).My favourite food is pizza (however,I have eaten only 5 times) but that dosen't matter because first time when I had pizza was on my admission in St.Karens Montessori School,later on St.Karens Collegiate School.From that time I was in love with pizza.And so,my favorite food is Pizza.</p>
